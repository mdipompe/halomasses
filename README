Main purpose is to convert bias to halo mass and vice versa
under some collapse model.

Current model choices are Tinker et al. (2010; 'tinker10'), Tinker et al.
(2005; 'tinker05'), and Sheth, Mo & Turman (2001; 'smt').

You can supply your own power spectrum to calculate the RMS mass fluctiations
(sigma(M)) for a given mass, or have the code call CAMB and get 
a power spectrum for you.  This relies on CAMB4IDL wrapper (see mdipompe on
 GitHub)
