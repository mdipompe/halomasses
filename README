Main purpose is to convert bias to halo mass under some collapse model.
Current model choices are Tinker et al. (2010; 'tinker10'), Tinker et al.
(2005; 'tinker05'), and Sheth, Mo & Turman (2001; 'smt').

Pretty much everything is done in mhalo2bias.pro, which is called from
bias2mhalo.pro, and the results are interpolated to your desired bias.
